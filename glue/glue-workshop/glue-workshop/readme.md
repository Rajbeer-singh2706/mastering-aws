Lab 1: Use AWS Glue to discover and store a metadata schema using the Glue Data Catalog and a Glue Crawler.

Lab 2: Use an the AWS Glue development tool of your choice i.e. Glue Development Endpoints, Glue Studio Notebook or Interactive Sessions, 
to create an integrated development environment for creating and testing Glue scripts. Demonstrate with code samples how to use standard PySpark and Glue-flavored PySpark to develop Glue ETL (extract, transform, load) code and use 3rd party Python libraries in Glue.

Lab 3: Develop, package, and deploy regular Glue ETL jobs and use Glue triggers to manage job execution.

Lab 4: How to develop Glue streaming ETL code in a notebook development environment and how to package and deploy it as a Glue Streaming job to process data from AWS Kinesis data stream.

Lab 5: How to use Glue DataBrew, a visual data preparation tool, to create a DataBrew dataset and dataset profile. Work inside DataBrew project and create a DataBrew Recipe, manage DataBrew recipes, and execute DataBrew jobs.

Lab 6: How to use Glue Studio to create ETL and streaming ETL jobs. Lab focuses on how to create custom transformation with Glue script in a notebook development environment.

Clean Up: Clean up the resources created for the labs to avoid charges.
